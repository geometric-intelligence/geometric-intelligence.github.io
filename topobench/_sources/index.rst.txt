:pushpin: Overview
------------------

``TopoBench`` (TB) is a modular Python library designed to standardize
benchmarking and accelerate research in Topological Deep Learning (TDL).
In particular, TB allows to train and compare the performances of all
sorts of Topological Neural Networks (TNNs) across the different
topological domains, where by *topological domain* we refer to a graph,
a simplicial complex, a cellular complex, or a hypergraph. For detailed
information, please refer to the
```TopoBench: A Framework for Benchmarking Topological Deep Learning`` <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06642>`__
paper.

The main pipeline trains and evaluates a wide range of state-of-the-art
TNNs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (see :gear: Neural Networks) on
numerous and varied datasets and benchmark tasks (see :books: Datasets
). Additionally, the library offers the ability to transform,
i.e. *lift*, each dataset from one topological domain to another (see
:rocket: Liftings), enabling for the first time an exhaustive
inter-domain comparison of TNNs.

:jigsaw: Get Started
--------------------

Create Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, clone and navigate to the ``TopoBench`` repository

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:geometric-intelligence/topobench.git
   cd TopoBench

Ensure ``conda`` is installed:

.. code:: bash

   conda --version || echo "Conda not found! Please install it from https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/"

Next, set up and activate a conda environment ``tb`` with Python 3.11.3:

.. code:: bash

   conda create -n tb python=3.11.3
   conda activate tb

Next, check the CUDA version of your machine:

.. code:: bash

   which nvcc && nvcc --version

and ensure that it matches the CUDA version specified in the
``env_setup.sh`` file (``CUDA=cu121`` by default). If it does not match,
update ``env_setup.sh`` accordingly by changing both the ``CUDA`` and
``TORCH`` environment variables to compatible values as specified on
`this website <https://github.com/pyg-team/pyg-lib>`__.

Next, set up the environment with the following command.

.. code:: bash

   source env_setup.sh

This command installs the ``TopoBench`` library and its dependencies.

Run Training Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, train the neural networks by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   python -m topobench 

--------------

Customizing Experiment Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to ``hydra`` implementation, one can easily override the default
experiment configuration through the command line. For instance, the
model and dataset can be selected as:

::

   python -m topobench model=cell/cwn dataset=graph/MUTAG

**Remark:** By default, our pipeline identifies the source and
destination topological domains, and applies a default lifting between
them if required.

Transforms allow you to modify your data before processing. There are
two main ways to configure transforms: individual transforms and
transform groups.

.. raw:: html

   <details>

Configuring Individual Transforms

When configuring a single transform, follow these steps:

1. Choose a desired transform (e.g., a lifting transform).
2. Identify the relative path to the transform configuration.

The folder structure for transforms is as follows:

::

   ├── configs
   │ ├── data_manipulations
   │ ├── transforms
   │ │ └── liftings
   │ │   ├── graph2cell
   │ │   ├── graph2hypergraph
   │ │   └── graph2simplicial

To override the default transform, use the following command structure:

.. code:: bash

   python -m topobench model=<model_type>/<model_name> dataset=<data_type>/<dataset_name> transforms=[<transform_path>/<transform_name>]

For example, to use the ``discrete_configuration_complex`` lifting with
the ``cell/cwn`` model:

.. code:: bash

   python -m topobench model=cell/cwn dataset=graph/MUTAG transforms=[liftings/graph2cell/discrete_configuration_complex]

.. raw:: html

   </details>

.. raw:: html

   <details>

Configuring Transform Groups

For more complex scenarios, such as combining multiple data
manipulations, use transform groups:

1. Create a new configuration file in the ``configs/transforms``
   directory (e.g., ``custom_example.yaml``).
2. Define the transform group in the YAML file:

.. code:: yaml

   defaults:
   - data_manipulations@data_transform_1: identity
   - data_manipulations@data_transform_2: node_degrees
   - data_manipulations@data_transform_3: one_hot_node_degree_features
   - liftings/graph2cell@graph2cell_lifting: cycle

**Important:** When composing multiple data manipulations, use the ``@``
operator to assign unique names to each transform.

3. Run the experiment with the custom transform group:

.. code:: bash

   python -m topobench model=cell/cwn dataset=graph/ZINC transforms=custom_example

This approach allows you to create complex transform pipelines,
including multiple data manipulations and liftings, in a single
configuration file.

   </details>

By mastering these configuration options, you can easily customize your experiments to suit your specific needs, from simple model and dataset selections to complex data transformation pipelines.

Additional Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Automatic Lifting:** By default, our pipeline identifies the source
   and destination topological domains and applies a default lifting
   between them if required.
-  **Fine-Grained Configuration:** The same CLI override mechanism
   applies when modifying finer configurations within a
   ``CONFIG GROUP``.
   Please refer to the official ```hydra``
   documentation <https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/>`__ for further details.

**Remark:** TopoBench includes
`TopoTune <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06530>`__, a comprehensive
framework for easily designing new, general TDL models on any domain
using any (graph) neural network as a backbone. Please check out the
extended `TopoTune wiki
page <https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/wiki/TopoTune>`__
for further details on how to leverage this framework to define and
train customized topological neural network architectures.

:rocket: Liftings & Transforms
------------------------------

We list the liftings used in ``TopoBench`` to transform datasets. Here,
a *lifting* refers to a function that transforms a dataset defined on a
topological domain (*e.g.*, on a graph) into the same dataset but
supported on a different topological domain (*e.g.*, on a simplicial
complex).

 Structural Liftings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The structural lifting is responsible for the transformation of the
underlying relationships or elements of the data. For instance, it might
determine how nodes and edges in a graph are mapped into triangles and
tetrahedra in a simplicial complex. This structural transformation can
be further categorized into connectivity-based, where the mapping relies
solely on the existing connections within the data, and feature-based,
where the data’s inherent properties or features guide the new
structure.

We enumerate below the structural liftings currently implemented in
``TopoBench``; please check out the provided description links for
further details.

**Remark:**: Most of these liftings are adaptations of winner
submissions of the ICML TDL Challenge 2024
(`paper <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v251/bernardez24a.html>`__ \|
`repo <https://github.com/pyt-team/challenge-icml-2024>`__); see the
`Structural Liftings
wiki <https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/wiki/Structural-Liftings>`__
for a complete list of compatible liftings.

+===================================+===================================+
| OneHotDegreeFeatures              | Adds the node degree as one hot   |
|                                   | encodings to the node features.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| NodeFeaturesToFloat               | Converts the node features of the |
|                                   | input graph to float.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| NodeDegrees                       | Calculates the node degrees of    |
|                                   | the input graph.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| NodeDegrees                       | Keeps only the selected fields of |
|                                   | the input data.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| KeepOnlyConnectedComponent        | Keep only the largest connected   |
|                                   | components of the input graph.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | of the input point cloud.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| InfereKNNConnectivity             | Generates the k-nearest neighbor  |
|                                   | connectivity of the input point   |
|                                   | cloud.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| IdentityTransform                 | An identity transform that does   |
|                                   | nothing to the input data.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| EqualGausFeatures                 | Generates equal Gaussian features |
|                                   | for all nodes.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| CalculateSimplicialCurvature      | Calculates the simplicial         |
|                                   | curvature of the input graph.     |
