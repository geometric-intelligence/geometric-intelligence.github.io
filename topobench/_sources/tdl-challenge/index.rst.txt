Motivation
----------

Topological Deep Learning (TDL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for
analyzing data with **topological neural networks**, a class of models that
extends Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture interactions beyond simple
pairs of nodes. While GNNs model pairwise links—like friendships in a social
network—many systems involve **higher-order relationships**, such as six atoms
forming a ring in a molecule or multiple researchers co-authoring a paper in a
co-authorship network. TDL provides a principled framework to represent and
learn from these richer, multi-way relationships, making it especially suited
for complex data in science and engineering.

**TopoBench** is the premier open-source platform for developing and
benchmarking TDL models. It provides a unified interface for datasets,
loaders, and tasks across topological domains. TopoBench enables reproducible
comparisons, accelerates model development, and serves as the central hub for
TDL experimentation.

For TDL to realize its full potential, the **data landscape must evolve**
(Papamarkou et al., 2024). The field’s current reliance on a handful of
well-worn benchmarks creates a bottleneck for innovation and rigorous
evaluation. To propel the field forward, we focus on the following fronts:

- **Broadening:** the foundational benchmarks of TDL by adapting diverse
  datasets from the GNN community and beyond.
- **Deepening:** TDL capabilities by building infrastructure for large-scale
  datasets and novel benchmark tasks.

We are calling on the community to build a richer, more robust, and scalable data ecosystem for TDL. 
By participating, you will be paving the way for the next generation of topological models.


Description of the Challenge
----------------------------

The 2025 Topological Deep Learning Challenge is organized into two primary
**missions** designed to systematically expand the TDL ecosystem: expanding the
data landscape and advancing the core data infrastructure. Participants are
invited to contribute one dataset (or dataset class, such as TUDataset) per
submission, where each submission belongs to one category. For examples of datasets
to contribute, please refer to the Reference Datasets Table below.. We also welcome
other datasets, either existing or novel (as long as they are hosted on an open-source
platform).

We invite participants to review this webpage regularly, as more details might be added to
answer relevant questions.

Mission A — Expanding the Data Landscape 📊
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mission focuses on enriching the TDL ecosystem with a diverse and meaningful collection of datasets.

Category A.1: Broadening Benchmarks with Graphs & Point Clouds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(Difficulty: Medium)*

Implement a well-established graph or point cloud dataset. Expand TDL’s applicability to
new fields. Alternatively, help bridge the gap between TDL and mainstream GNN research by
incorporating the challenging benchmarks used to test modern graph models. TopoBench includes
a suite of topological transforms that will be able to “lift” these graph-based or point cloud
datasets to higher-order domains, such as hypergraphs or simplicial complexes.

Category A.2: Curating Natively Higher-Order Datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(Difficulty: Medium)*

Integrate datasets where higher-order structures (e.g., simplicial complexes, hypergraphs) are
a native feature of the data, rather than being algorithmically inferred by transforms in TopoBench.
These datasets are critical for testing the unique expressive power of topological models.

Mission B — Advancing the Data Infrastructure 💻
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Category B.1: Developing Large-Scale Inductive Data Infrastructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(Difficulty: Hard)*

This mission focuses on building the scalable and versatile software tools needed
for next-generation TDL research. It challenges participants to engineer a
**scalable data loading pipeline** for large-scale *inductive* learning settings,
accommodating datasets with either many small graphs or a few giant ones.

The primary obstacle is that standard ``InMemoryDataset`` loaders often fail when
preprocessing large datasets—especially during memory-intensive “lifting”
operations that construct higher-order topological domains. This process can
easily exhaust system RAM, leading to crashes.

**Core task.** Implement a robust ``OnDiskDataset`` loader that processes and saves
each sample to disk individually, effectively bypassing memory bottlenecks and
enabling datasets that were previously intractable.

.. admonition:: Bonus (Difficulty: Survival)
   :class: tip

   Tackle **large-scale transductive learning** with an ``OnDiskDataset`` loader.
   This is significantly more complex and requires a deep understanding of both
   TDL pipelines and the TopoBench architecture. If interested, please contact
   the organizers (see *Questions* section) for details.

Category B.2: Pioneering New TDL Benchmark Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(Difficulty: Varies)*

Introduce **novel benchmark tasks** beyond standard node-level classification.
Each submission must pair a **dataset** with the **infrastructure** needed to
establish it as a new benchmark, including **data splits**, **evaluation metrics**,
and a **baseline model**.

**Example topics:**

- Link prediction in hypergraphs
- Higher-order cell classification or regression
- Hyperedge-dependent node classification
- Your own creative proposal

Reward Outcomes
---------------

⭐ **White paper**: Every submission that meets the requirements will be included
in a white paper summarizing the challenge’s findings (planned via PMLR through
Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science 2025). Authors of qualifying
submissions will be offered co-authorship. [1]_

🏆 **Cash prizes**: Four winning teams (one per category) will be announced at
TAG-DS 2025 during the Awards Ceremony.

- 💰 **Mission A** winners: $200 USD each (sponsored by `Arlequin AI <https://www.arlq.ai/>`__).
- 💰 **Mission B** winners: $800 USD each (sponsored by `Arlequin AI <https://www.arlq.ai/>`__).

🌴 **Visit opportunity — Geometric Intelligence Lab, UCSB (USA):**
A team, pending evaluation results and interest, will be invited for a visit
of up to **two months** at the Geometric Intelligence Lab, University of
California, Santa Barbara. During the visit, winners will work on cutting-edge
methods for TDL. Travel costs will be reimbursed and financial assistance for
lodging will be provided. Remote participation is also available. [2]_

🏔️ **Research internship — IMOS Lab, EPFL (Switzerland):**
A team, pending evaluation results and interest, will be invited for a research
internship at the **Intelligent Maintenance and Operations Systems (IMOS) Lab**
at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. Winners will develop TDL methods in a
world-class academic environment. **MSc enrollment** at the time of the
internship is required. Financial assistance for lodging will be provided; winners
will likely need to secure a **visa** and **work authorization**.

.. note::
   Organizers reserve the right to **reallocate prize money** between categories
   in the event of a significant disparity in the number or quality of submissions.

.. [1] Due to legal restrictions, U.S. researchers may be unable to co-author
   papers with scholars from certain countries or institutions. Participants are
   responsible for verifying their eligibility.

.. [2] The visit is contingent on obtaining the necessary permission to work in
   the United States and fulfilling all other legal, institutional, and administrative
   requirements.


Deadline
--------

The final submission deadline is **November 25th, 2025 (AoE)**. Participants may
continue modifying their PRs until this time.

Guidelines
----------

- **Eligibility:** Participation is free and open to all. However, for legal reasons,
  individuals affiliated with institutions that appear in the sections of the
  `Restricted Foreign Research Institutions <https://www.research.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/ri/Restricted%20Foreign%20Research%20Institutions.pdf>`__
  list are not eligible for the reward outcomes of the challenge — including
  co-authorship on the white paper summarizing the challenge findings and submissions.

- **Registration:** To participate in the challenge, participants must
  (1) open a **Pull Request (PR)** on **TopoBench** and
  (2) fill out the `Registration Google Form <https://forms.gle/je9PNDXiebY36XMT6>`__
  with PR and team information. **Each submission (i.e., each PR) must be accompanied
  by a Registration Form** to be valid.

- **Picking a dataset:** Please refer to the open Pull Requests in TopoBench
  (`see open PRs <https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/pulls>`__)
  to see which datasets are already being implemented in each category.

- **Submission:** For a submission to be valid, teams must:

  - Submit a valid PR before the deadline.
  - Fill out the registration form before the deadline.
  - Ensure the PR passes all tests.
  - Tag the PR with the appropriate category (one of:
    ``category-A1``, ``category-A2``, ``category-B1``, ``category-B2``).
  - Respect all submission requirements.

- **Dataset loaders:**

  - Each PR may contain **at most one** dataset loader.
  - A loader may support multiple datasets, but in such cases, the PR should
    include **separate configuration files** for each dataset.
    (Example: TopoBench uses the “TUDataset” class from PyG and provides multiple
    configuration files for its different datasets.)

- **Teams:**

  - Teams are allowed, with a **maximum of 2 members**. (If you wish to form a larger team,
    please contact the organizers — see the *Questions* section — for discussion and approval.)
  - The same team can submit multiple datasets through different PRs. Make sure to
    register on the Google Form (`link <https://forms.gle/7NT9Zv1wsSKQaSfS9>`__)
    for **each PR**.
  - The same team can participate in multiple challenge categories.

- **Early submissions:**

  - We encourage participants to submit PRs early. This allows time to resolve potential issues.
  - In cases where multiple high-quality submissions cover overlapping datasets,
    earlier submissions will be given priority consideration.


Submission Requirements
-----------------------

A submission consists of a **Pull Request (PR)** to **TopoBench**. The PR title must be:

``Category: [A1|A2|B1|B2];  Team name: <team name>;  Dataset: <Dataset Name>``

Submissions may implement datasets already proposed in the literature or **novel datasets**.
For novel datasets, neither the challenge nor its related publications will prevent you from
publishing your own work — you retain full credit for your data. We only ask that the data be
hosted on an **open-source platform**.

Requirements for Mission A (Categories A1 and A2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``{name}_dataset_loader.py`` **or** ``{name}_datasets_loader.py``

   a. Store in ``topobench/data/loaders/{domain}`` where ``{domain}`` is the dataset’s
      domain (e.g., ``graph``).

   b. Define a class ``{Name}DatasetLoader`` implementing ``load_dataset()`` that loads
      the entire dataset (optionally with pre-defined splits).

   c. This class must inherit from ``data.loaders.base.AbstractLoader``.

2. *(Only if necessary)* ``{name}_dataset.py`` **or** ``{name}_datasets.py``

   a. Store in ``topobench/data/datasets``.

   b. Define a class ``{Name}`` implementing the required interfaces for
      ``InMemoryDataset``. See existing examples in the directory for the required functions.

3. **Testing**

   a. All contributed files must pass pre-existing unit tests in ``test/data``.

   b. Any contributed methods that are not currently tested must be accompanied by new
      test files stored in the appropriate subdirectory of ``test/data``. Each contributed
      test file should include test functions that correspond one-to-one with contributed
      functions (as in existing tests).

   c. TopoBench uses Codecov to measure coverage. Your PR must **match or exceed 93%**
      coverage. You can find the Codecov report as a bot comment on your PR after CI runs.

   d. Include a pipeline test showing that a model (any model already in TopoBench) can
      train on your dataset. Specifically, fill out ``test/pipeline/test_pipeline.py`` with
      a dataset and model configuration of your choice to prove the pipeline runs
      successfully. *We do not evaluate submissions by training performance.*

.. tip::
   For a step-by-step example, see the tutorial:
   `tutorial_add_custom_dataset.ipynb <https://github.com/geometric-intelligence/TopoBench/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial_add_custom_dataset.ipynb>`__.


Requirements for Mission B (Categories B1 and B2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mission may require significant contributions and modifications to **TopoBench**,
so explicit, exhaustive requirements are not feasible. Participants are encouraged to
follow the general structure and logic of TopoBench as much as possible; however,
given the complexity of these tasks, this constraint is flexible.

**Minimum expectations**

- **Coverage:** Match or exceed the existing **93%** Codecov coverage target.
- **Testing:** Include at least one **pipeline test** demonstrating that a model
  (either existing or newly contributed) can train on the contributed dataset/task
  for a limited number of epochs (see point **3.d** of the Mission A submission
  requirements for an example).

**Coordination and support**

- We are happy to discuss implementation and testing ideas. Please reach out at
  ``topological.intelligence@gmail.com``.

.. note::
   For **very large datasets (Mission B1)**, write tests that operate on **small slices**
   of the data to keep CI/runtime reasonable and avoid lengthy tests.



Evaluation
----------

Award Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One winning submission will be crowned per mission category:

- **Category A.1:** Best “Expanding Graph-Based Datasets” implementation
- **Category A.2:** Best “Expanding Higher-Order Dataset” implementation
- **Category B.1:** Best “Large-Scale Inductive Dataset” implementation
- **Category B.2:** Best “New TDL Benchmark Task” implementation

Additionally, two teams will be selected for **invited visits** across all mission
categories based on overall quality, level of difficulty, and impact of contribution.
**Honorable mentions** may also be awarded. Exceptional attention will be given to
any successful **B1 Bonus** submission.

Evaluation Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A panel of TopoBench maintainers and collaborators will vote using the
**Condorcet method** to select the best submission in each mission category.

Evaluation criteria include:

- **Correctness:** Does the submission implement the dataset correctly?
  Is it reasonable and well-defined?
- **Code quality:** How readable and clean is the implementation?
  How well does the submission respect the requirements?
- **Documentation & tests:** Are docstrings clear? Are unit tests robust?

.. important::
   These criteria do **not** reward final model performance on the dataset.
   The goal is to deliver well-written, usable datasets/infrastructure that
   enable further experimentation and insight.

A panel of TopoBench developers and TDL experts will decide on the **two teams
to be invited for visits**, pending interest as indicated in their Registration Forms.
Internship opportunities and cash prizes are **not** mutually exclusive.
